# Features
 - RPI 4 + RPI CAM + Infrared + Steerable Head + Ultrasonic. Freenove 4WD Kit.
 - Source code gotten from the kit, gutted and reworked to be more pythonic and interface with my additions.
 - Implemented and Tested Line Following Algorithm w/ Camera using ROS(Robot Operating System), then ported it over.
 - Person Detection and Tracking using a wrapper for YOLOv4.
 - Web Teleoperation Interface with Camera Stream and Overlays using Flask.
 
 
# Next Steps
 - Implementing Monocular Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) from scratch as ROS doesnt give me enough control or understanding.
